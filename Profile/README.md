# Manufacturing Monitoring System
<center> <img src="https://github.com/SmartFactory-Team/Documentation/blob/main/LogoTeam.png"> </center>

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based manufacturing monitoring system that simulates a simple production line. The application displays machine statuses, tracks inventory flow, and logs downtime incidents through a dashboard.

The goal is to model how real manufacturing operations monitor performance and reliability while keeping the scope realistic for a semester-long software engineering project.

---

## Key Features
- Simulated machine status (running, idle, down, maintenance)
- Inventory tracking through production steps
- Downtime and incident logging
- Web-based dashboard for system visibility
- Incremental development using Scrum practices

---

## Project Scope
This system uses simulated data rather than real manufacturing hardware or sensors.

The focus is on software design, requirements development, testing, and team collaboration. Advanced optimization, real-time hardware integration, and AI-based decision making are intentionally out of scope to ensure the project remains achievable within one semester.

## Technologies (subject to change)
- Backend: Python / Java / Node.js  
- Frontend: Web-based UI (HTML/CSS/JavaScript or framework)  
- Database: SQL or NoSQL  
- Version Control: GitHub
